        <h4>More About Functions</h4>
        <p>One quick note off the back is Memoization this allows you to cache values for quick references to quickly reference values that might make calculations quicker for references. Immediately Invoked Functions allow for you to make a function that is immediately used as soon as it is defined. This has a lot of features and utility but one I will talk about is creating a self-contained Code block that doesn’t interfere with other parts of the programs this allows you to test code and can be useful when troubleshooting issues. Asynchronous programming allows you to execute code in a specific order while not holding up the program, Async functions were introduced in ES2017 and use the keyword await to perform these kinds of operations. Closures allow us to access variables in functions while they aren’t running whereas normally, we would be unable to access these variables you can do this by nesting functions within functions you can also alter these variables as well. Pure Functions are key for functional programming and it follows 3 rules: The function only relies on arguments provided in the function, doesn’t change values elsewhere, and it will return the same result given the same values.</p>
        <h4>Ajax</h4>
        <p>Ajax is an acronym for using Asynchronous, JavaScript and XML in order to have snappier and more responsive web pages where you can request data but load your page without having to wait for that function to work. The fetch method only needs one mandatory argument which is the url you want to use. Ajax is used to communicate with external API’s which allow you to use which allow you to use data to make objects on your site for instance grabbing weather data for a city to display temperature, wind speed and other information. You can create Request interface that contains info about the request as well as headers that can create http headers. </p>
