        <h2>The Window Object</h2>
        <p>You can use the window object for quite a few things some quick ones are: window.alerts(), window.confirm() and window.prompt(). You can also use window.location to find pertinent information about the website for instance where they currently are, what’s the host and you can load another URL as a parameter. Cookies can be used to storeo local data on ones computer. You can add, edit and delete cookies using document.cookie. also important notes seting timers and intervals to make notifications in programs.</p>
        <p>A youtube.com popup will occur and an alert after 10 seconds</p>
        <h2>API</h2>
        <p>There are many API’s that are built into HTML5 that you can access via javascript. One popular one is local storage which we have used in other applications that I made for my to do list application. Other applications include using geolocations and running multiple processes at once. Websockets allow for 2-way communication most of the time it is limited to one way but websockets allow for the connection to remain open. You can also use a media api to better display audio and video and have options to use things like canvas which we used last week. </p>
