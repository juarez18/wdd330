        <h2>Client Side Form Validation</h2>
        <p>Validating forms before they are sent to servers is an important step with user interface and speed. This allows for when a client is filling out information to double-check before sending information to a server that they have filled out the information correctly before the server process it and returns with an error. Common validating forms are Required, phone number, email address, and password requirements. You can use each built-in form checks within HTML5 or you can also use JavaScript as well. An example of HTML is keywords added to the tags like required, pattern, and setting min and max lengths. JavaScript can use commands from the Constraint Validation API to accomplish similar sets if HTML built-in form is not supported. </p>
        <h2>That's so Fetch</h2>
        <p>The fetch API allows you to use JavaScript to manipulate HTTP to receive requests and responses. Some important fetch specs are the promise returned from fetch won’t reject on HTTP error status, fetch can receive cross site cookies and fetch won’t send cookies. Within fetch you also have a number of different settings to change exactly what you get and can change things like method, mode, credentials, headers and so on. A few interesting things I found interesting you can use fetch to upload JSON data and files. Headers allow you to map names and values within a header object. </p>
