                Forms (Chapter 8)
            </h4>
            <p>Forms are a vital part of any website as it allows you to take and process information from a user to make your site more interactive. Forms can be used a variety of ways from logins, to getting information to even bingo games here are some important functions of forms: Using forms to retrieve values and change values, different types of input forms: input, select, text area and buttons.</p>

                Object Oriented Programming (Chapter 12)
            </h4>
            <p>Object oriented programming allows you to make pieces of code that can easily be reused and altered. Encapsulation is a program that keeps the actual code hidden from me but I can insert variables and data into it and get results, Polymorphism is various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation and finally inheritance is taking an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods. Use constructors to create instances of an object and in ES6 you can use the class keyword in place of them. </p>
